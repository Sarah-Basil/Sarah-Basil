# Hi there, I‚Äôm Sarah Basil! üëã

**Undergraduate @ Stevens Institute of Technology | Computer Science Major | BTT AI Fellow | Creative Technologist**

I‚Äôm passionate about merging technology with creativity and design, exploring new ways to solve real-world problems through **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **innovative design**. With experience in **Python, Java, C, C++**, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and creative tools (Adobe Creative Suite), I love leveraging code and art to craft meaningful experiences.

As a **Break Through Tech AI Fellow**, I‚Äôve strengthened my ML foundations through Cornell University‚Äôs coursework and collaborative projects with industry mentors. Currently, I‚Äôm applying these skills as an **AI Studio Fellow at JPMorgan Chase**, tackling credit card fraud detection challenges and exploring advanced modeling techniques.

### üéØ Featured Project: Fall AI Studio Project ‚Äì Credit Card Fraud Detection
*As part of the Break Through Tech AI Studio project in partnership with JPMorgan Chase*

**What We‚Äôre Doing:** Collaborating with a team of 5-7 fellows to build a predictive model for credit card fraud detection. Applying supervised learning techniques (classification, regression) and exploring ensemble methods and potentially deep learning to achieve robust results.

**Key Steps:**  
- **EDA & Feature Engineering:** Using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and scikit-learn for data preprocessing.  
- **Modeling & Evaluation:** Training various models, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance (precision, recall, F1-score) to identify the best fraud detection approach.  
- **Next Steps:** Presenting findings to stakeholders and proposing future integration (e.g., front-end app) to maximize real-world impact.

*Stay tuned for the final project repo link and README!*
